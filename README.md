# HibernateTutorial
This project is a simple tutorial I created to learn Hibernate, an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool for Java. It helps map Java classes to database tables and manage database operations using Java code.

🔧 What I Learned
How to configure Hibernate using hibernate.cfg.xml

Creating entity classes and mapping them to database tables

Performing basic CRUD operations

Using Hibernate Annotations

Writing HQL (Hibernate Query Language)

Handling relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many)

🛠️ Tools Used
Java

Hibernate

PostgreSQL (or any DB)

Maven (for dependencies)

🧠 Tips
Always close your Hibernate sessions to avoid memory leaks.

Use transactions wisely to avoid partial updates.

Understand the implications of lazy vs eager loading.
